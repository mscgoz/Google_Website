# Google

Hello, world!

This is the first project that I completed by re-implementing Google's Homepage, Advanced Search, and Image Search.

In this project, I used pure HTML & CSS. 

Here are the features of each section:

<h2> Homepage </h2>

<h3> Google Search </h3>

After a query, the search button routes the user to the related Google search result page.

<h3> I'm Feeling Lucky </h3>

After a query, the I'm Feeling Lucky button routes the user to the first Google search result page.

<h2> Image Search </h2>

After a query, the user gets directed o the related Google Image Search result page.

<h2> Advanced Search </h2>

Depending on the form used, the user gets directed to the related Google search results page with the user's demand (such as including/excluding a word from a query)
